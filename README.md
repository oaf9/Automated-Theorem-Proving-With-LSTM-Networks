Using LSTM generators to Prove Theorems in Predicate Logic. The code lives in the code folder in root. 
View the Paper In the Root Directory. 
You can replicate the results obtained in the paper or play with the model 
by running the cells in the interactive Notebook. 
If you don't want to use the notebook, you can also train the model by running train_model.py as a script. 
run growth.py to replicate Figure 5.
